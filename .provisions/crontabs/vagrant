# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
*/5 * * * * su -s /bin/sh nobody -c 'cd /repoA && git pull --rebase origin master >> /tmp/rebaseA.log'
*/5 * * * * su -s /bin/sh nobody -c 'cd /repoB && git pull --rebase origin master >> /tmp/rebaseB.log'
